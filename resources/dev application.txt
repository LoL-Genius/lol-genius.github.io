Product name= LoL Genius


Product Description=
I want to make analysis easier for players. Not everyone has the technical capability to get the stats they want using the Riot API (e.g., CS difference at 10minute intervals)- LoL Genius is a product designed to bridge the gap between players & the Riot Games API.

Specifically, the player indicates what stats they want, but I also generate derivative stats like damage per gold. While part of the deliverable is analysis of those stats, I also provide players with the raw data should they want to examine it.

Currently, I have specified three product tiers from just the data (free) to detailed analysis (price TBD).

The APIs we are using are Summoner (to get match histories), Match (to get match stats), and League (to get the challenger ranked players to compare stats).
